Compiling goes as follows:  
./Makefile // this will do everything for you   
./steemit input_file // running for "input_file"  
A great example is inside of the current folder with name "full_example.c"  
To run this example you do:  
./steemit full_example.c  
This example contains most statements that our grammar supports!  
I also include the dump files (symbol table and revisit queue) that are generated by that example.
